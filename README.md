# Roger Dodger
Roger Dodger is an interactive python mini game which consists of an airplane navigating through the sky to avoid 
incoming missiles. It was a summer project which allowed me to perfect my usage of the Tkinter Python Library. To play,
please download all the files into one folder and run the file called "Roger Doger". Enjoy!
